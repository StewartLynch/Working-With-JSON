# Working-With-JSON

This is a simple example of how you can load JSON into an array of objects that are defined in the "Models.swift" file.  

The initial JSON data is stored in a json file within the main bundle of the project "SeedData.json"

The project allows you to update the data for the User and Family objects abd then give you the option to create new JSON.

The newly created JSON is printed to the console.



The reading (decoding) and creating (encoding) of the json is done through the two functions found in the "DataSource.swift" file
